# Stone Wall Calculator

This is a simple Java console application designed to calculate the required materials and costs for building a stone wall with a concrete foundation. The application breaks down the needed quantities of concrete and reinforcing steel rods (rebar), as well as the amount of stone and/or formwork blocks if applicable. From my personal experience, a wall in combination with formwork blocks has advantages such as speed of construction, better handling of stones (working with smaller stones) and more, but this wall is more expensive in terms of material.

## Features
- Calculates the volume and cost of concrete for a specified foundation size.
- Calculates the amount and cost of reinforcing steel rods based on the foundation length.
- Determines stone and/or lost formwork requirements for the wall, depending on the selected construction method (stone only or stone with lost formwork).
- Provides a detailed cost breakdown of materials.

## Usage
This application runs in the console. The user inputs the dimensions and material prices, and the program outputs the total material quantities and cost estimates.

## Input Details
Foundation dimensions: Width, length, and depth.
Material costs: Price per cubic meter of concrete, price per meter of rebar.
Wall dimensions: Width, length, and height.
Construction method: Choice between stone only or stone with formwork blocks.

## Example Output


## Future Improvements
- Add option to calculate wall construction time, labor or excavation cost.
- Allow users to save and load previous calculations.
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.
